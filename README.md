*Hey KITT! Go and fetch some data for me!*

This repo contains examples of how to programmatically retrieve data of some sources relevant to my research:

- Weather Underground
- Hydrology and climatology data using [ulmo](https://github.com/ulmo-dev/ulmo):
  - [National Climatic Data Center - Global Historical Climate Network Daily](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ghcn-daily-description)
