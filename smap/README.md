# Soil Moisture Active Passive

SMAP data usually comes packed in HDF5 files. Most likely the approach showed here is applicable to other data sets also available in NASA's [Common Metadata Repository (CMR)](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/about/science-system-description/eosdis-components/common-metadata-repository).
